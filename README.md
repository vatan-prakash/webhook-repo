## GitHub Webhook Event Tracker

This project is a GitHub webhook event tracker built with Flask and MongoDB, designed to capture and store webhook events from GitHub repositories. The project is structured to handle different types of webhook events such as pushes, merges, and pull requests, and store them in a MongoDB database for later retrieval and analysis.

### Features

- **Webhook Handling**: Captures events from GitHub webhooks.
- **Event Storage**: Stores event data in a MongoDB database.
- **REST API**: Provides endpoints to view recent events.
- **Dockerized**: Easily deployable using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Render for studying webhook events.
